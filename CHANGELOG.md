## [Unreleased]

### Added — TypeScript: model-level attribute dictionaries, so a written file can carry SketchUp's native `GeoReference` geolocation block

`writeAttributeDict` has always been able to write a named attribute dictionary, but only ever as a child of a component definition, instance, group or face - the `attributeDicts` parameter those four share. Nothing could attach one to the MODEL, which is where SketchUp keeps the block that makes a file geolocated: a dictionary named `GeoReference`, carrying `Latitude`/`Longitude`/`GeoReferenceNorthAngle`, the `ModelTranslationX`/`Y`/`Z` offsets (minus the UTM easting/northing of the model origin, in inches), a free-text `LocationSource`, and `UsesGeoReferencing`. Model Info > Geo-location, the sun and shadow engine, Add Location and KMZ export all read it, so a file without it is a file SketchUp treats as sitting nowhere in particular.

`SkpBuilder.addModelAttributeDict(name, entries)` writes one. The awkward part is not the dictionary but where it has to go. The model's own `CAttributeContainer` is the last field of the model record, immediately ahead of the material list - and in a brand-new document it is a 2-byte NULL pointer, not a container at all. It is emphatically *not* the first `CAttributeContainer` in the file: that one is declared by whichever record first carries one (a component definition's `Name`/`Description`/`IsClassified` properties, in real files), and a `GeoReference` dictionary written into it produces a file SketchUp opens and reports as "This model is not geo-located". So `toBytes()` replaces that null pointer with a real container holding one `CAttributeNamed` child per dictionary, in exactly the byte shape SketchUp itself writes there. The placement is where the slot bookkeeping comes from for free: the container and its dictionaries take the first archive slots at `BASE`, the ones the material writer would otherwise have handed out, so the existing material shift already covers them at every site that applies it (the scaffold class-slot map, the layer/definition/geometry writers' starting slots, the active-layer anchor's back-reference to Layer0, every reference in the document tail). Because that renumbering is not retroactive, `addModelAttributeDict` must be called before any material, layer, definition, group, face or instance call, and throws with an explanation rather than silently corrupting references if it is not. The insertion point itself is guarded: `toBytes()` checks that the scaffold really does carry a null pointer there and refuses to write if a swapped scaffold ever changes that shape.

Attribute values may now also be **booleans**, written as SketchUp's own 1-byte bool type (`0x07`) - the type real files use for `UsesGeoReferencing` and for the scaffold's own `IsClassified`/`IsDynamic`/`IsLive`. This replaces the previous outright rejection of booleans ("use 0/1 instead"), which was never right: `0x07` is a distinct type the reader has always decoded, just one the writer could not produce. It decodes as the number `1`/`0`, not as a JS boolean, so a boolean round-trips as `1`/`0`.

On the read side, `SkpModel.attributes` (and `ParsedRawData.attributes`) now surfaces the model's dictionaries as `{ dictName: { key: value } }`. Legacy (pre-2021 MFC) files only - the walk starts AT the material manager and derives its slot base from that anchor, so it cannot be rewound over the model record and this is read separately and best-effort; VFF files report `{}` until the equivalent TLV location is found. It anchors on the same material count the walk does: the container ends 14 bytes before it (an undecoded model-record tail that is byte-identical in every legacy file this repository bundles, v17 and v20 alike), and its start is found by scanning back for a container that decodes and lands exactly on that end. Verified against this repository's own real fixtures: `capilla_quiroz_v17.skp` and `gondola_v20.skp` - both geolocated in real SketchUp with Set Manual Location - report their genuine `GeoReference` (latitude 40.018309, longitude -105.242139, `LocationSource` "Manual"), `GSU_ContributorsInfo` and `temp` dictionaries, while the blank v17 scaffold and `single_material_v17.skp`, whose pointer is null, report `{}`. A written file with a `GeoReference` dictionary plus a textured material, two layers, a component definition with a thumbnail and two instances, a group and root faces parses back with every count intact, which is what proves no shifted slot reference was missed. Output for a file that never touches the new API is byte-identical to before (the 6149-byte single-face ground truth Python's own writer is cross-checked against still holds exactly).

### Added — TypeScript: `ShadowInfo` location, the second record a geolocated file needs

A geolocated `.skp` carries its location **twice**, in two unrelated records, and `addModelAttributeDict('GeoReference', ...)` above only writes one of them. That dictionary is what makes SketchUp report a file as accurately geo-located, but it is not what Model Info > Geo-location displays, and not what the sun and shadow engine casts from: those read the model's `ShadowInfo` record, which the bundled blank scaffold fills with SketchUp's own default, Boulder, Colorado. Setting the dictionary alone produces a file that opens geo-located while still showing, and shading for, Boulder. That split is not hypothetical: both real fixtures this repository bundles were re-geolocated to Boulder in real SketchUp with Set Manual Location, and their `ShadowInfo` still names the city each model was authored in (Barcelona and Brasilia).

`SkpBuilder.setShadowInfoLocation({ city, country, longitude, latitude, tzOffsetHours })` writes the second one. Strings default to `""` and the timezone offset to 0; coordinates are range-checked, and a city or country past 254 characters throws (the record's string encoding carries a single length byte). Unlike `addModelAttributeDict` it may be called at any point before `toBytes()`, and calling it again replaces the previous value: the record lives in the undecoded document tail and costs no archive slots, so nothing about it can renumber a reference.

What it does cost is a **resize**. The record is the first thing in that tail, ahead of every internal reference `toBytes()` renumbers there and both ISO camera patches, so a city or country of a different length than the scaffold's own "Boulder (CO)"/"USA" moves all of them. It is therefore applied as one more action in the tail's existing ascending-order, growth-tracking loop rather than as a separate pass, which is what keeps every later action landing at its moved offset. The splice is guarded on the values it replaces, not just on an offset: `toBytes()` checks that SketchUp's five defaults really are sitting there and refuses to write otherwise, so a swapped scaffold fails loudly instead of writing a city over the middle of some other field. Output for a file that never calls the method is byte-identical to before, and writing the defaults back is byte-identical to not calling it at all.

On the read side, `SkpModel.shadowInfo` (and `ParsedRawData.shadowInfo`) surfaces the record as `{ city, country, longitude, latitude, tzOffsetHours }`, or `null`. Legacy (pre-2021 MFC) files only; VFF files report `null` until the equivalent TLV location is found. The anchor is structural, not a byte-pattern search and not the scaffold's own offset: the record starts exactly where the walk stops, one past the last root entity, and is validated by its header shape (a run of zero bytes around a `time_t` whose value differs in every file) plus three plausible angles where longitude, latitude and the UTC offset belong. Verified against all four legacy files this repository bundles - two versions, two writers, four very different offsets: `blank_v17.skp` and `single_material_v17.skp` report SketchUp's Boulder default, `capilla_quiroz_v17.skp` reports Barcelona and `gondola_v20.skp` Brasilia, each alongside the Boulder `GeoReference` that disagrees with it.

### Fixed — Python: pre-2014 legacy files could silently drop most of the root scene, or crash deep in a nested definition (#284)

`_read_instance`'s trailing-GUID read for `CComponentInstance`/`CGroup` was gated on the class's own reported `schema` number (`schema >= 5` implies a GUID), which doesn't hold: a v7 file's `CComponentInstance` reports schema 6 - well above that threshold - yet has no GUID at all. Forcing the 16-byte read anyway silently consumed bytes belonging to the start of the next sibling entity's own tag. Two symptoms turned out to share this one cause: a `"class-ref to non-class slot N (CAttributeNamed)"` crash deep inside a nested `CComponentDefinition` (the originally-reported bug), and - more dangerous, since it never raised - the root-level entity list's own over-declared-count tolerance silently swallowing the resulting corruption and truncating a real scene from 10+ root instances down to 1 with no error at all. Root-caused with a byte-level trace on a real V7 file (not committed, private project content) and fixed by gating the GUID read on the file's own version number instead of schema, then re-verified byte-for-byte against V7/V8/2013 real files and a clean synthetic fixture pair. `is_legacy` detection, `expected a string record` (v3), `texture object is not a dib` (v4), and `definition list misaligned` (v6) remain separate, unrelated pre-existing bugs, still open.

### Added — Web viewer: WASM fast-preview path for files too large for the pure-JS parser

`examples/web-viewer` bundles the C++ engine's WASM build (`wasm/openskp.js`/`openskp.wasm`) and offers it as an additional option on the existing large-file warning dialog - "Load fast preview (WASM)" alongside "Load anyway" and "Cancel". It hands the raw bytes to the native parser and renders the GLB it returns via Three.js's `GLTFLoader`, trading away layers, the properties inspector, and every export format (`parseSkpToGLB()`'s return value carries none of that metadata) for a load that actually finishes instead of freezing the tab.

Verified on a real 41MB production file that the existing pure-JS path cannot load at all (`Array buffer allocation failed` partway through parsing, a real, reproducible failure - not a synthetic edge case): the WASM path loaded it successfully in 14.9s (1,497,547 faces, 2,696 mesh resources, 32 materials), rendered correctly. Confirmed the existing full-featured path is unaffected for files under the warning threshold.

### Fixed — Web viewer: zooming out on a large model could clip the whole scene into nothing

The camera's near/far clipping planes (`0.1`/`1000`) and OrbitControls' zoom distance were fixed constants sized for the small default sample model, with no `maxDistance` limit at all. A real building-scale model comfortably exceeds a 1000-unit far plane, so zooming out past that distance clipped the entire scene - it just vanished, with nothing to indicate why. `zoomToFit()` now computes near/far and `controls.minDistance`/`maxDistance` fresh from the loaded model's own bounding box on every load (also rescales fog density along with the far plane, so a large model doesn't fog out immediately either). Verified across a wide zoom range on a real 165MB production model: no clipping artifacts zoomed in close, and zooming out to the new (bounded) maximum keeps the model visible - small, correctly, at that distance - rather than clipped away. Confirmed the small default sample model's appearance is unaffected.

### Fixed — `to_instanced_glb()` was accidentally quadratic in mesh-resource count (not a WASM-specific issue)

`make_model()`'s shared binary buffer was grown via `append_values()`
calling `buffer.reserve(buffer.size() + delta)` once per primitive per
attribute array (positions/normals/uvs/indices) - `std::vector::reserve()`
has no obligation to over-allocate beyond what's asked, so a size that only
ever grows by "just enough" forces a full reallocation-and-copy of
everything appended so far, every single call. On a scene with many mesh
resources this turned amortized-O(1) appends into O(resource count²)
copying - **39,016ms → 485ms (an 80x speedup) at 10,000 resources, and
713s → 12.6s (56.6x) at 65,000**, real numbers from a synthetic 125MB file,
fixed by reserving the true final buffer size once, upfront (byte-identical
output, confirmed on the same file before/after).

This corrects a wrong conclusion from the memory-ceiling fix entry just
below: profiling (not just black-box timing) found the real hot path was
`to_instanced_glb()` itself, not the legacy parser - the earlier "WASM is
12-13x slower than native" claim compared WASM's full parse+build+GLB
pipeline against a native benchmark that never called `to_instanced_glb()`
at all. Once compared correctly, this bug affected native and WASM
equally; there was no WASM-specific slowdown. See
[issue #305](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp/issues/305) for
the full corrected investigation.

### Fixed — C++ WASM build hit an internal memory ceiling well below what a browser tab actually allows

The `OPENSKP_BUILD_WASM` target set `-sALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1` with no explicit
`-sMAXIMUM_MEMORY`. Without one, the WASM heap hit an internal allocation
failure - caught generically and surfaced as a misleading `legacy .skp parse
failed` error, with the real exception type lost - well before a browser's
own ~4GB ceiling would actually be reached. Confirmed directly: a synthetic
125MB file with 65,000 component definitions failed outright under the old
config; adding an explicit `-sMAXIMUM_MEMORY=4GB` (plus a 256MB
`-sINITIAL_MEMORY` to avoid repeated grow-and-copy on real files) removed the
failure. See [issue #305](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp/issues/305)
for the fuller investigation, including a separate, still-open WASM-vs-native
performance gap this fix does not address.

### Fixed — Cross-language codegen textured material round-trip

`to_*_code()` now preserves both `applied_width` and material `opacity` when regenerating textured materials across all 5 language ports (Python, TypeScript, .NET, Dart, C++).

### Changed — TypeScript writer memory

`ArchiveWriter` keeps the archive in a growable `Uint8Array` instead of a
`number[]`, and `SkpBuilder.toBytes()` assembles the file into one exact-size
buffer instead of a second `number[]` plus a final copy. A `number[]` costs
about 9 bytes of heap per file byte, so a 62 MB write peaked at ~2.1 GB of
transient heap and took a browser tab down; it now peaks at ~0.2 GB. Output is
byte-identical. No public API change (`_internal.GrowableBytes` is exposed for
tests).

## [preview-cpp-v1.3.0] — 2026-09-10 — C++ only, GitHub-only pre-release

> **This is a preview tag, not the numbered `cpp-v1.3.0` release.** It's a

> build it by checking out this tag directly and following
> [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)'s C++ install steps
> (build/install `packages/cpp`, then `find_package(OpenSkp CONFIG
> REQUIRED)`). It folds into a proper numbered `cpp-v1.3.0` release once
> the known gaps below are closed and cross-language parity work catches
> up — tracked in [docs/LANGUAGE_PARITY.md](docs/LANGUAGE_PARITY.md) and
> [issue #285](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp/issues/285).

### Added — C++: Direct SketchUp → Fragments (.frag) export

New `openskp::to_fragments()` / `openskp::export_fragments()`
(`fragments_export.cpp`), porting Python's `openskp.export.fragments`
line-for-line: real nested spatial hierarchy, per-item GUIDs (the source
file's real per-instance SketchUp GUID on VFF/2021+ files, a stable
synthetic one otherwise), non-unit scale/mirrored instances baked into
geometry. Verified against the real `@thatopen/fragments` runtime, not just
this project's own reader — including two real production files (2,239 and
14,694 items), both with every GUID confirmed distinct and non-empty and
`mesh_resources` counts matching Python's own output on the same files
exactly (987/987 and 9,614/9,614).

Roughly 5-9x faster end to end than the equivalent Python pipeline on the
same real files (parse + scene build + export): ~9.6s vs ~84s on a 14MB
file, ~97s vs ~500s on a 173MB file.

**Known gaps, stated honestly:**
- Attribute dictionary values decode as strings only — no `Point3d`/
  `Vector3d`/`Length`/nested-list support, matching this port's existing
  string-only property handling elsewhere. See
  [LANGUAGE_PARITY.md](docs/LANGUAGE_PARITY.md).
- Same Fragments-format caveats as Python's own implementation: no native
  per-layer visibility field (carried via a `Model.metadata` JSON sidecar
  instead), `Model.guid` unpopulated.

### Added — C++: multiple attribute dictionaries per entity

`Instance::attribute_dictionaries` / `InstancedNode::attribute_dictionaries`
now expose every attribute dictionary an instance carries, keyed by the
dictionary's own declared name — not just SketchUp's own
`dynamic_attributes`. Fixes a real bug found while building the Fragments
port: the previous single-dictionary attribute reader flattened every
dictionary's entries into one map regardless of source, so a third-party
plugin's own dictionary (e.g. a steel-detailing tool's own named
dictionary) silently mixed into `Instance::properties`, and the baked
(`build_scene`) name-resolution path had no attribute-dict-override
fallback at all. Both `instanced_scene.cpp` and `scene.cpp` now resolve
display names the same way Python's `instanced_scene.py`/`scene.py` do:
attribute-dict override → instance's own name → definition's own name
(unless auto-generated) → internal index fallback.

### Fixed — C++: 4 correctness issues in IFC export

Ports Python's `1.3.0` IFC fixes to `ifc_export.cpp`, verified against a
real production file (steel-detailing plugin data included) as well as
new unit tests mirroring Python's own (`packages/python/tests/test_ifc.py`).

- **Units and axis convention** — `to_ifc()`/`export_ifc()` always declared
  the length unit as millimetres but defaulted their coordinate scale to
  `METRES_TO_INCHES` — every coordinate was written inch-scaled but
  labeled millimetre, off by ~25.4x in any IFC consumer that respects the
  unit declaration. Default scale is now `METRES_TO_MM` (1000.0). Vertex
  positions (baked in glTF's Y-up convention for GLB export) are now
  converted back to IFC/SketchUp's Z-up convention instead of being
  written through raw — the previous behavior exported buildings rotated
  ~90 degrees and mirrored.
- **Real instance names and layer visibility** — elements were named
  after `GlbPrimitive::geom_name` (an internal mesh-lookup key, e.g.
  `"mesh_3115_ROOT__Component_6205261_Layer0"`) instead of the real
  SketchUp instance name. Now uses `MeshMetadata::name`. Also switches
  the IFC layer assignment from `IFCPRESENTATIONLAYERASSIGNMENT` to
  `IFCPRESENTATIONLAYERWITHSTYLE`, which can actually carry a layer's
  on/off state (`LayerOn`) — new `Scene::layer_hidden` field, threaded
  through from the parser's existing per-layer hidden state (legacy
  pre-2021 files only; VFF files always read visible here, a separate,
  open gap — see [LANGUAGE_PARITY.md](docs/LANGUAGE_PARITY.md)).
- **Plugin attribute dictionaries surfaced as element names and IFC
  properties** — `build_scene()` (`scene.cpp`) gained the same
  attribute-dict-override name-resolution fallback `instanced_scene.cpp`
  already had, plus a deferred mesh backfill mechanism (mirroring
  Python's `path_updates`) so each mesh's real per-instance name,
  properties, and attribute dictionaries are known by the time `to_ifc()`
  reads them — new `MeshMetadata::attribute_dictionaries` /
  `InstanceNode::attribute_dictionaries` fields. Each dictionary becomes
  its own `Pset_<dict-name>` in IFC output, separate from
  `Pset_CustomProperties`. This also closes a pre-existing, previously
  documented gap: `mesh_index[...].properties` was never populated at
  all in the C++ baked path before this fix.
- **Opt-in full-path keyword classification** — `classify_element()`/
  `to_ifc()`/`export_ifc()` gain `classify_using_full_path` (default
  `false`, so existing callers see no behavior change): when a name/layer
  match both miss, fall back to matching the full ancestor-path string.

Also fixes a latent bug this work surfaced: `dxf_export.hpp` and
`ifc_export.hpp` each declared their own `METRES_TO_INCHES` constant in
the same `openskp` namespace — a redefinition error in any translation
unit including both. Moved to a single definition in `model.hpp`. The
`openskp.hpp` umbrella header was also missing `fragments_export.hpp`
and `ifc_export.hpp` entirely — both now included.

### Added — C++: read the real per-layer hidden flag from VFF (2021+) files

Ports Python's VFF layer-hidden fix to `geometry.cpp`'s `collect_layers()`.
VFF-format files previously derived a layer's visibility only from
`Layer_<name>`-prefixed materials, which carry no hidden/visible bit of
their own — every VFF layer's hidden state silently defaulted to visible
regardless of the file's actual Tags panel state, which also meant the
IFC exporter's `IFCPRESENTATIONLAYERWITHSTYLE.LayerOn` (above) always
reported visible for VFF files.

The real flag lives right alongside the already-parsed layer id/name:
each layer's `8C3C` node carries an `8E3C` single-byte sibling (`1` =
hidden, `0` = visible). Verified against two real production files: the
same cladding/sheeting-layer + label-layer hidden pattern Python found
on its own file showed up independently on a different file here (5 of
30 layers correctly flagged hidden, all cladding/sheeting/label layers).
3 new unit tests exercise `collect_layers()` directly against hand-built
TLV node trees.

### Fixed — C++: `model.layers` now in source-file order, not alphabetical

`RawParsed::layer_colors` is a `std::map` (sorted by key), so every
consumer of `model.layers` previously saw layers alphabetized rather
than in the order they actually appear in the source file (material.xml
archive-entry order for VFF, slot-scan order for legacy) - Python's own
`layer_colors` is a plain dict, which preserves insertion order
natively, so this was C++-only behavior, not a cross-language
difference in the underlying data. New `RawParsed::layer_order`
(a `std::vector<std::string>`, populated at every layer-insertion site
in `core.cpp`/`legacy.cpp`) is what `model.cpp`'s layer-building loop
now iterates. Verified byte-for-byte identical order to Python's own
output on the same real production file (30 layers, non-alphabetical).

### Added — C++: read pages/scenes for legacy (pre-2021) files

Ports Python's `legacy._scan_pages` (narrow scope) to `legacy.cpp`'s new
`scan_pages_for_layers`. Legacy (pre-2021 MFC) `.skp` files had no page/
scene reading code at all in C++ - `SkpModel.pages` was only ever
populated for the VFF path, matching a gap Python itself only closed
recently.

CViewPage's full record also embeds a camera, an optional thumbnail, a
font, and (for any of several independently-optional capture flags
beyond hidden-layers) an entire Style sub-object of undocumented size.
Scoped down deliberately, matching Python exactly: only the flag
combination capturing nothing, or only hidden-layers, is supported;
anything else is silently skipped rather than guessed at, so an
unsupported page is simply absent from `model.pages` instead of
producing wrong data. Runs as an independent scan over the file tail
(from where the main entity walk stops) rather than part of the
sequential archive read, to avoid needing to fully bound each page's
opaque tail.

Also exposes `LegacySlotEntry`/`LegacySlotTable`/`scan_pages_for_layers`
via `internal.hpp` (`struct V` moved out of `legacy.cpp`'s own anonymous
namespace to make this possible without duplicating it) so this feature
is unit-testable the same way VFF's `parse_pages`/`parse_dimensions`
already are - previously, legacy.cpp's internals were only reachable
through real fixture files. 2 new unit tests exercise
`scan_pages_for_layers` directly against hand-built byte records
mirroring Python's own `test_scan_pages_legacy_synthetic` test exactly
(three candidate pages, one with an unsupported flag combination
correctly rejected).

**Known gap, stated honestly:** not exercised against a real file that
actually contains a legacy scene - none of the committed fixtures or
the real production files available while building this had one (5
real files smoke-tested: no crash, no false positives, all correctly
report zero pages since none of them have any). Ground truth for the
byte layout itself was already established by Python's own
implementation, ground-truthed against real v17-native SketchUp saves;
this port carries that over faithfully rather than re-deriving it.

### Added — C++: read construction lines/points (legacy only)

Ports Python's `legacy._read_constructionline`/`_read_constructionpoint`
reading side to `legacy.cpp` (writer/`create.py`'s side is out of scope
here, per this round's own priority - see `docs/LANGUAGE_PARITY.md`'s
still-open "Writer: construction lines/points" row). Both entity types
were already being parsed (needed for archive slot-sync) but their
fields were read and immediately discarded - new `ConstructionLine`/
`ConstructionPoint` model types and `Definition::construction_lines`/
`.construction_points` fields now surface them, matching Python's own
`ConstructionLine`/`ConstructionPoint` dataclasses field-for-field.

A bounded `CConstructionLine` stores a point + normalized direction +
two signed distance parameters along that direction marking the
segment's start/end - translated into the same start/end/direction
shape `Sketchup::ConstructionLine`'s own Ruby API exposes. An unbounded
line uses a large-magnitude sentinel (start/end come back unset,
matching the real API returning `nil`). A `CConstructionPoint` stores
its position plus a second, always-zero 3-double block and a trailing
byte with no corresponding Ruby property - left unexposed, matching
Python exactly.

Verified against a real committed fixture (`capilla_quiroz_v17.skp`): 7
real construction points, every coordinate byte-for-byte identical to
Python's own parse of the same file. No construction lines were
available in any fixture or real production file to verify against -
stated honestly in `docs/LANGUAGE_PARITY.md` rather than glossed over.

### Fixed — `attribute_dictionaries` missing from GLB/JSON metadata export

`json_export.cpp`'s `instance_node_to_json`/`mesh_metadata_to_json`
already had access to `attribute_dictionaries` (correctly resolved by
`build_scene()`, added earlier in this same GitHub-only phase) but never
wrote it into the JSON output — only the IFC exporter surfaced this data
(as `Pset_<dict-name>` properties). Both functions now include an
`attribute_dictionaries` key alongside `properties`, matching the same
fix ported to Python's `export/glb.py`, `export/json_export.py`, and
`export/instanced_glb.py` - see
[§ 1.3.0](#130--2026-09-09--python-only-github-only-pre-release).
Verified against real plugin data on `Untitled.skp` (`steelframer-dict`,
45 entries); full suite green (217/217).

## [1.3.0] — 2026-09-09 — Python only, GitHub-only pre-release

> **This tag is not published to PyPI.** It's a real, tested, tagged release
> — install it with:
> ```
> pip install "openskp[fragments] @ git+https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp.git@python-v1.3.0#subdirectory=packages/python"
> ```
> It will fold into a PyPI release once cross-language parity work below
> catches up across the other 4 languages. Everything in this section is
> Python-only unless stated otherwise.

### Added — Direct SketchUp → Fragments (.frag) export

New `openskp.export.fragments` module (`to_fragments(scene, *, raw=False)` /
`export(scene, output_path, *, raw=False)`) writes ThatOpen's public
Fragments/FlatBuffers format straight from an `InstancedScene`, with no IFC
intermediate — real nested spatial hierarchy (matching the source file's own
component nesting, not a flat list), IfcImporter-compatible display names,
per-item GUIDs (the source file's real per-instance SketchUp GUID on VFF/2021+
files, a stable synthetic one on legacy files), and non-unit scale/mirrored
instances baked correctly into geometry (Fragments' own `Transform` struct has
no scale field). New optional dependency group: `pip install openskp[fragments]`
(`flatbuffers>=24.0`), vendored FlatBuffers bindings under `_fragments_fb/`.
Verified against the real `@thatopen/fragments` runtime, not just this
project's own reader, including a production-scale real file (12,338 items).

**Known gaps, stated honestly:**
- No other language has this yet. A community TypeScript port is open as
  [PR #276](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp/pull/276) but its
  required lint check is currently failing — not mergeable as-is. .NET, Dart,
  and C++ have no Fragments work started at all.
- The Fragments format itself has no native visibility field. Per-layer
  hidden state is carried via a `Model.metadata` JSON sidecar — a convention
  this project defined, not part of the public ThatOpen schema. Any other
  consumer of the `.frag` file needs to know to read it.
- `Model.guid` (the single model-level identifier, distinct from each item's
  own per-instance guid) is still an unpopulated placeholder.

### Changed — Face triangulation: Shapely replaced with earcut

Two-part performance and correctness change to `triangulate_face_3d`:
a convex, hole-free face now triangulates via a direct fan (zero fidelity
change, 10–44% faster on real fixtures); every other face now triangulates
via `mapbox_earcut` instead of Shapely's Delaunay-plus-centroid-containment-
filter approach (42–73% faster on top of the fan fast path). This is also a
real correctness fix, not just speed: Shapely's centroid-containment filter
was found under-covering a real concave 27-vertex face by roughly 10.5% of
its area, confirmed against an independent shoelace-formula ground truth.
New mandatory dependency: `mapbox_earcut>=1.0`.

### Fixed — 4 correctness issues in IFC export

- **Units and axis convention** — coordinates were written inch-scaled but
  labeled as millimetres (~25.4× off), and the axis convention reused
  glTF's Y-up values directly instead of converting to IFC/SketchUp's Z-up
  — a real export came out rotated ~90° and mirrored. Found by diffing
  against SketchUp's own native IFC export.
- **Real instance names and layer visibility** — `to_ifc()` previously named
  elements after internal mesh-lookup keys instead of the real instance
  name, and used `IfcPresentationLayerAssignment` (no on/off state) instead
  of `IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle` (carries `LayerOn`). New
  `Scene.layer_hidden` field. Legacy files now get correct on/off state in
  IFC output; VFF (2021+) files still always report visible in this
  specific export path — the VFF hidden-flag read added below was not yet
  wired into the IFC exporter, tracked as an open follow-up.
- **Plugin attribute dictionaries surfaced as element names and IFC
  properties** — `build_scene`/`build_instanced_scene` now extract every
  attribute dictionary an instance carries (not just `dynamic_attributes`),
  and use `name`/`label`/`code` (priority order) for the display name when
  present. Each dictionary becomes its own `Pset_<dict-name>` in IFC output.
  Targets real steel-detailing plugin data (`fbd-einfo`/`fbd-profile`/
  `fbd-profile-cords`) that previously had no way to reach the exported
  model at all.
- **Opt-in full-path keyword classification** — `classify_element()`/
  `to_ifc()` gain `classify_using_full_path` (default `False`, so existing
  callers see no behavior change): when a name/layer match both miss, fall
  back to matching the full ancestor-path string.

### Added — Read the real per-layer hidden flag from VFF (2021+) files

New `8E3C` single-byte sibling tag read on each layer's `8C3C` node.
Previously VFF layer visibility was inferred only from `Layer_<name>`-
prefixed materials, which carry no hidden bit at all — every VFF layer
always read as visible regardless of its real state in the source file.

### Added — `layer_hidden` in both GLB exporters' metadata sidecars

`export/glb.py` and `export/instanced_glb.py` now surface
`Scene.layer_hidden` / `InstancedScene.layer_hidden` in their `_metadata.json`
output, so a consumer can apply the source file's real default layer
visibility without re-deriving it.

### Added — Read pages/scenes for legacy (pre-2021) files

`legacy._scan_pages` populates `Page.name`/`.hidden_layers` for legacy MFC
files — previously only the VFF (2021+) reader path populated `SkpModel.pages`
at all. Scoped narrowly and deliberately: only pages whose capture flags are
"nothing" or "hidden layers only" are supported; a page with a fuller capture
(camera, style, shadow info — the common case for a hand-arranged scene) is
silently skipped rather than guessed at, so it's simply absent from
`model.pages` instead of producing wrong data.

### Added — Write section planes

`SkpBuilder.add_section_plane(point, normal)`, ground-truthed against real
v17-native SketchUp saves and verified by opening the written file in live
SketchUp (correct plane readback and visual render).

### Added — Read and write construction lines/points

`legacy._read_constructionline`/`_read_constructionpoint` now retain their
fields instead of discarding them (`Definition.construction_lines`/
`.construction_points`); writer gains `add_construction_line`/
`add_construction_point` (root-level only). Ground-truthed against real
SketchUp saves; a missing 4-byte trailer bug (previously rejected by real
SketchUp as "unexpected file format") was found and fixed during that
verification.

### Fixed — large real files could exhaust all available memory or stall for 16+ minutes

Two independent bugs, both confirmed against a real 359MB/95,363-definition
production file that had crashed a 40GB development machine:
- The TLV parser's `iter_top_level_lazy` already streamed ordinary top-level
  records one at a time, but a file whose definitions are nearly all nested
  under one dominant `F901`→`7017`→`7117` wrapper (rather than spread across
  many top-level records) forced the *entire* wrapper's subtree to be
  materialized in memory before any of it could be processed and released.
  Extended the same streaming principle one level deeper via a new
  `_unwrap_definitions_container()` helper.
- `triangulate_face_3d`'s fallback path did an O(V) linear nearest-vertex
  scan per triangle corner, making triangulation of any large, non-trivial
  face effectively O(V²). Replaced with an O(1) reverse-coordinate-lookup
  dict built once per face.

Combined, the real trigger file now completes in ~773s at a peak of ~12.5GB
RSS instead of crashing outright. Fixes
[#264](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp/issues/264).

### Fixed — files the writer produced could not be SAVED by SketchUp (Python writer)

Every section's writer (materials, layers, definitions, root geometry) handed out persistent IDs
from 1 again, so a material, a definition and a root instance could all carry pid 1, and the header's
pid counter — a 32-bit field the writer treated as 16-bit — only grew by the material and layer count.
SketchUp loads such a file, renumbers the duplicates, and then `SUModelSaveToFile` fails with
`SU_ERROR_SERIALIZATION` once the model is big enough or a definition happens to come first: a real
7 MB export opened fine in SketchUp Web and every attempt to save it ended in "Save failed". Measured
with the SDK: a 1-face definition followed by a 3-face one is enough. Pids now run in one sequence
across sections, continuing from the scaffold's counter, and the counter is written as the u32 it is,
with the last pid handed out. Real exports of 7 MB and 27 MB re-save through the SDK.

### Added — face-me components in the writer (Python)

`add_component_definition(name, always_faces_camera=True, shadows_face_sun=True)` sets SketchUp's
component-behavior byte the reader already decoded (bit 0 / bit 1 of byte −9 in the definition's
43-byte gap), so a 2D person or cut-out tree written with openskp turns toward the camera in
SketchUp instead of standing still. `openskp.edit` replays a source file's flags when re-saving.

### Fixed — `front_uv`/`back_uv` pins land where SketchUp draws them, on any face and at any applied size (Python writer)

Two defects in the writer's texture positioning, invisible to its own reader tests because every
test square happened to be axis-aligned and every test material 1 inch per tile:

- **Basis.** The per-face matrix was solved in a basis built from the face's *first edge*
  (`points[1] - points[0]`, and the normal crossed with it). Real SketchUp — and this project's own
  reader, calibrated against SDK-authored files — express and invert it in a basis derived from the
  **normal alone** (`U = normalize(Z × n)`, `W = n × U`; `(X, ±Y)` for a horizontal face). The two agree
  exactly when the first edge runs along `Z × n`, which every existing test face did; otherwise the
  texture came out turned by the angle between them. A horizontal face listed from another corner
  arrived in SketchUp rotated 90° or 180°; a curved surface of many small quads, each with its own
  first edge, shattered. `_uv_matrix_for_face` now uses `_face_groups.face_uv_basis`.
- **Scale.** SketchUp stores the matrix in *inches of texture space* and divides by the material's
  applied width/height when it reads a face's UV back (`compute_face_uv` already did the same). The
  pins a caller gives are in tiles of the image, and were fitted as-is, so a material applied at
  2 m per tile (78.74 in) came out 78.74× too big on every positioned face. `add_face` (root and
  definition builders) now scales pins by the applied size recorded at `add_texture_material` time;
  `openskp.edit` and `to_python_code` write the source's real applied size again instead of forcing
  `applied_height=1.0` to dodge the double division.

- **Vertical tolerance and the downward basis (reader and writer).** `face_uv_basis` treated a
  normal as vertical only within 1e-9 of it, and gave a face looking down the basis `(X, −Y)`. Real
  SketchUp, measured with the SDK on faces tilted from 1e-10 to 1e-2 looking up and down, keeps the
  world axes while the sine of the tilt is below 1e-3, and turns the basis 180° for a downward face:
  `(−X, +Y)`. A horizontal face whose stored normal carries float noise, and every underside of a
  model, read back (and were written) turned. `VERTICAL_TOLERANCE = 1e-3` in `_face_groups`.

Measured through the SDK's own `SUMeshHelperGetFrontSTQCoords` (skp2dae) on 11 orientations before and
after; new tests pin the invariant — what you pin is what the reader hands back at that point, on
six orientations and vertex orders, and at applied size 10 — plus a real-SketchUp oracle test for the
rotated vertex order (`TestRealSketchUpOracle`, needs the SDK DLL).

### Fixed — `attribute_dictionaries` missing from GLB/JSON metadata export

Every attribute dictionary an instance carries (not just SketchUp's own
`dynamic_attributes`, which `properties` is scoped to exclusively per
[#254](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp/issues/254)) was already
correctly resolved by `build_scene()`/`build_instanced_scene()`, but was
never written into `export/glb.py`, `export/json_export.py`, or
`export/instanced_glb.py`. Only the IFC exporter surfaced this data (as
`Pset_<dict-name>` properties) — a consumer reading GLB/JSON metadata
instead of the derived `.ifc` (e.g. a third-party plugin's own named
dictionary, such as a steel-detailing tool's `steelframer-dict`) silently
never saw it. `_instance_node_to_dict`/`mesh_index` in all three export
modules now include an `attribute_dictionaries` key alongside the existing
`properties` key, keyed by each dictionary's own declared name. Verified
against real plugin data on `Untitled.skp` (`steelframer-dict`, 45
entries); no output shape change for models with no extra dictionaries
(`attribute_dictionaries` is simply `{}`). Same fix ported to C++, see
[§ preview-cpp-v1.3.0](#preview-cpp-v130--2026-09-10--c-only-github-only-pre-release).

### Added — Read a `.frag` file back (`openskp.export.fragments.read`/`from_fragments`)

The mirror of this release's own `to_fragments`/`export`: parses a real
`.frag` file straight into an `InstancedScene`, OpenSKP's 6th input format
alongside `.skp`. Any file works, not just this project's own encoder's
output — ThatOpen's real `IfcImporter` output, or anyone else's — and
rides every other export this project already has (GLB, OBJ, STL, PLY,
DXF, IFC4, JSON, `.skp` itself via the writer) for free, once parsed.

Verified three ways: round-trips this project's own output exactly (world-
space vertex positions across a real `.skp`-derived scene match to the
last bit, not just object/vertex counts); reads a real ThatOpen-produced
production file cleanly (a genuine IFC-derived building, 5,751 nodes /
100,332 vertices, not a synthetic fixture) — re-exporting that file
through this same module and loading the result back through the actual
`@thatopen/fragments` runtime preserves real IFC GUIDs and category
names; and, independently of any pre-existing fixture, converts real IFC
source files (a Revit-exported wall, and a real ~8.6 MB structural model)
through ThatOpen's own actual `IfcImporter` and reads the freshly-produced
`.frag` output straight into an `InstancedScene` — correct spatial
hierarchy, GUIDs, and geometry counts, with `CIRCLE_EXTRUSION` samples
(present in the structural model) skipped with a warning as documented.
A smaller real ThatOpen fixture (MIT-licensed, from their own
`resources/frags/`) is committed at
`tests/fixtures/thatopen_small_test.frag` for CI.

**Known gaps, stated honestly:**
- No UVs or stored vertex normals anywhere in the schema — every
  reconstructed primitive gets an all-zero UV band, and normals are
  rebuilt as flat per-face (correct for a hard-edged shell, not the
  original smooth-shading groups). Not a gap in this reader — the format
  itself never had anywhere to keep either.
- A purely organizational (non-geometry) node's own local transform was
  never serialized on export — only geometry-bearing items' full WORLD
  transforms survive. Reconstructed wrapper nodes get an identity matrix;
  since every geometry leaf's own matrix is its full world transform
  directly, the composed placement is still exactly correct, it just
  can't recover the original per-level transform split.
- `RepresentationClass.CIRCLE_EXTRUSION` (round profiles — rebar, pipes)
  has no reader yet, only `SHELL`. A real `IfcImporter`-produced file can
  contain these; such samples are skipped with a warning, not silently
  misread as shells.

### Fixed — `.frag` reader crashed on real ThatOpen-produced files (wrong shell lookup)

`from_fragments` resolved each sample's geometry via `Representation`'s
own position in the `Representations` vector, treating that position as
the index into `Meshes.Shells`. That's only true of this project's own
writer, which happens to always keep the two equal — `Representation.Id()`
is the actual `Shells` index, and a real ThatOpen `IfcImporter`-produced
file does not keep it equal to the representation's vector position.
Surfaced as an `IndexError` reading a `.frag` file freshly converted from
a real structural IFC model via ThatOpen's own `IfcImporter` (not caught
by any prior test, since every previous fixture — including this
project's own writer's output — happened not to exercise the divergence).
Fixed by following `Representation.Id()`, matching the real reader's own
`meshes.shells(repr.id!, ...)` (`Utils/edit/fetch-functions.ts` in
`@thatopen/fragments`). Regression test patches a representation's
`Id()` in place to diverge from its vector position and confirms the
correct (not merely non-crashing) shell comes back.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-09-04

### Added — Full attribute-dictionary support in the writer, Python; groups gain attributes, all 5 languages

The writer's custom attribute dictionaries (`attributes`/`attribute_dict_name` on
`add_component_definition`, `add_instance`, and `add_face`) previously only accepted `str`/`int`/
`float` values, silently rejected `bool`, and were unavailable on groups at all. Python's writer
now supports every value type the reader already decoded: `None`, `bool`, `int`, `float`, `str`,
new `Point3d`/`Vector3d` wrapper types (a position/direction, distinct from a plain 3-element
array), `Length` (a distance, written distinctly from a plain float), `Timestamp`, and nestable
lists of any of these. An entity can now also carry **multiple** named attribute dictionaries at
once via a new `attribute_dicts=[(name, entries), ...]` parameter alongside the existing
single-dict shorthand. Dictionary names are no longer discarded on read, on both the legacy and
modern (VFF) parsing paths — `Instance.attribute_dictionaries` exposes every dictionary by name
and real (non-stringified) value type, while `Instance.properties` keeps its existing
`dynamic_attributes`-only, stringified view for backward compatibility. A new explicit
`with builder.definitions():` / `with builder.instances():` phase API also improves the error
message when geometry is added in the wrong order relative to material/layer/definition setup.

**Groups can now carry attributes too, in all 5 languages** (`add_group`/`add_group_instance`
gain the same `attributes`/`attribute_dict_name` parameters `add_instance` already had) — a group
only gets a real attribute container when one is actually given, matching how faces already work,
rather than always writing a null pointer as before. Real production files routinely have
attributed groups (SketchUp's own Dynamic Components, and third-party tools that build assemblies
as groups rather than component instances), and previously any attributes attached to a group were
silently discarded on write. TypeScript/.NET/Dart/C++ get this same group-attribute support at
parity with what `add_instance` already offered there (a single dictionary at a time) — the
multi-dictionary `attribute_dicts` list above stays Python-only for now.

### Added — Applied texture size and material opacity, all 5 languages

`add_texture_material`/`write_textured_material` gained `applied_width` (alongside the existing
`applied_height`) — real SketchUp writes a texture's tile size in both axes, and a texture applied
without explicit positioning now carries a real mapping in both dimensions instead of just one.
`add_material`/`add_texture_material` also gained `opacity` (`0.0` fully transparent, `1.0` fully
opaque), round-tripping correctly through the reader's own `Material.transparency` field.
Originally contributed for Python; ported to TypeScript, .NET, Dart, and C++ with matching
behavior in every language.

### Added — SketchUp Image entity writer support (`add_image`), all 5 languages

Places a genuine `CImage` entity — the object SketchUp creates via File → Import → Image — rather
than just a textured face; consumers that give images special billboard/cutout treatment can now
tell the two apart via `Definition.is_image`. Also fixes a matching legacy-reader gap: `CImage`
records were already parsed but never surfaced as placed instances, and `is_image` was hardcoded
`false` for every legacy (pre-2021) file. Along the way, found and fixed a real texture-corruption
bug: `write_textured_material`'s applied-height defaulted to a corrupted internal sentinel value
whenever a caller omitted it, which the read-side UV formula divides by even for an explicitly
pinned mapping — not just default-projected faces as first assumed. The default now correctly
resolves to `1.0` in every language, matching applied width's existing default.

### Added — Writer support for linear dimensions and leader text (Python); VFF scene/dimension parsing ported to all 5 languages

`add_dimension` writes a "free" linear dimension between two explicit points (anchoring a
dimension to specific geometry is not yet supported — tracked as a known follow-up). `add_text`
writes a leader text label anchored at a point, with the label and connecting leader line
positioned in world space, matching how real, human-drawn leader texts are structured (SketchUp's
own SDK-generated texts are screen-space only). Both are Python-only for now. Separately, parsing
of VFF (2021+) scenes ("pages" — name, camera, projection, hidden-layer overrides, surfaced as
`SkpModel.pages`) and linear dimensions (world-space endpoints, resolved through a placed
instance's transform when a dimension is anchored to geometry inside one) is ported from Python to
TypeScript, .NET, Dart, and C++.

### Added — Instancing-preserving scene output, all 5 languages

**Instancing-preserving scene output.** A new `buildInstancedScene()` /
`build_instanced_scene()` / `BuildInstancedScene()` keeps the instancing
SketchUp already recorded, instead of baking it out the way
`buildScene()` does. Each distinct definition is triangulated once, in its
own local space, and every placement becomes a node carrying the transform
that puts it there — so output scales with `unique geometry + instance
transforms` rather than `definition geometry x placement count`. A
companion `toInstancedGLB()` / `to_instanced_glb()` / `ToInstancedGlb()`
writes glTF 2.0/GLB in which many nodes reference one mesh, so a
definition's vertex and index buffers are written once rather than once
per placement — Python's `openskp.export.instanced_glb`, TypeScript's
`toInstancedGLB`, .NET's `InstancedGlbExport.ToInstancedGlb` /
`.ExportInstancedGlb`, Dart's `toInstancedGlb`, and C++'s
`to_instanced_glb` all share the same shape. It landed in TypeScript
first, then was ported to Python, .NET, Dart, and C++ — each cross-checked
against TypeScript's own already-verified output the same way the
SKP-to-code generator below was.

This is lossless instancing preservation, not mesh decimation: no
vertices are removed, merged, quantised or approximated, and no new
dependencies are introduced. The triangles are exactly the ones
`buildScene()` produces. The test suite asserts that directly, by
flattening the instanced result and comparing it against the baked one on
the repository's real `.skp` fixtures, in every language.

On a synthetic scene of one 24-face component repeated 1,000 times
(TypeScript benchmark; the underlying algorithm is identical across
languages), the geometry buffers are 1,000x smaller (3,562 KB to 3.6 KB),
the exported GLB is 48x smaller, and the build is 46x faster. Run
`npm run bench:instanced` in `packages/typescript` to reproduce.

`parseSkp()`/`parse()`, `buildScene()`/`build_scene()` and
`toGLB()`/`export_glb` are unchanged in behaviour, return type and output
in every language. See
[Choosing an API](packages/typescript/README.md#choosing-an-api).

### Added — SKP-to-code generator, all 5 languages

`openskp.to_python_code()` / `toTypeScriptCode()` / `Codegen.ToCSharpCode()`
/ `toDartCode()` / `to_cpp_code()` walks a parsed `SkpModel` and emits
human-readable, re-runnable source that calls that same language's own
writer API to rebuild an equivalent file — a faithful transcript of API
calls, not a serialized dump. Handles materials (solid and textured, with
explicit `front_uv`/`back_uv` pins computed for every textured face, even
ones that originally used default projection), layers, component/group
definitions built in dependency order, faces (holes, auto-triangulation
for near-planar real-world faces), and instances (transform,
instance-level paint, instance-level name — including a genuinely empty
name, which is different from an omitted one). See
[Generating code from a file](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#generating-code-from-a-file).

Building and testing this against a real, large file (`jeff.skp`: 2713
definitions, 113643 faces, 2581/2713 painted instances) surfaced three
pre-existing bugs shared by every language's existing
`open_existing`/`edit.*` replay path, fixed there too:

- **Instance-level paint silently dropped.** SketchUp lets you paint a
  whole component/group instance once instead of every internal face;
  every language's replay path never passed the instance's own `material`
  option when rebuilding.
- **Instance names silently replaced.** A genuinely empty stored instance
  name was converted to the writer's "omitted" sentinel before calling
  `add_instance`, defeating the writer's own correct
  name-defaults-to-definition-name fallback and baking in the wrong name.
- **Textured materials replayed corrupted.** Every replay path called
  `add_texture_material` without `applied_height`, leaving in place the
  library's internal corrupted-sentinel default (already fixed in the
  writer itself for `add_image`, but the replay callers were never
  updated).

A fourth bug, found while building the new codegen and then also present
in the existing replay logic: blindly sampling the first 3 vertices for a
UV correspondence can pick a collinear triple on real "flat" geometry,
which the writer's UV solver correctly rejects — fixed via a
non-collinear-triple search helper in both the new codegen and the
existing replay logic.

### Added — TypeScript performance and API surface improvements

- Vertex coordinates now stored in a flat `Float64Array` with an id→index
  mapping instead of `Map<number, [x, y, z]>` — 1.6x lower memory on real
  files, chosen after benchmarking against a sorted-array alternative that
  saved more memory but cost ~35% on the hot lookup path.
- Edge display flags (hidden/soft/smooth) now stored in a `Uint8Array`
  instead of `Map<number, number>` — roughly 30x less memory per edge.
- `isDrawableEdge(edge)` and an opt-in `respectEdgeVisibility` option on
  the scene builders, for consumers who want SketchUp's own
  hidden/soft/smooth edge semantics respected rather than every edge
  drawn.
- GLB export narrows glTF indices to `UNSIGNED_SHORT` where a primitive's
  vertex count allows it (all 266 primitives across this repo's fixtures
  qualify today), instead of always writing 4-byte `UNSIGNED_INT` — about
  8% smaller GLB files, 13% smaller for the instanced exporter. Purely an
  encoding choice at the export boundary; in-memory arrays are unchanged.
- `extractThumbnail(buffer)` returns the preview image already embedded in
  a `.skp` file without parsing geometry; `SkpScene.bounds`/
  `InstancedScene.bounds` expose the model's axis-aligned extent
  (`min`/`max`/`size`/`center`) without sweeping every position by hand.

### Fixed — Six legacy MFC reader gaps found sweeping real engineering files, ported to all 5 languages

Found by a contributor sweeping a round-trip harness over real projects (Python first, then
ported to TypeScript, .NET, Dart, and C++): textured colour-by-layer (`CLayer` can carry a full
texture, not just flat RGBA); `CDimensionLinear`'s trailer read structurally instead of as a fixed
165-byte skip, since each connection-point reference is 2 or 6 bytes depending on where the
archive crosses its own big-tag-escape boundary; forward-tolerant references for `CRelationship`
and text-leader attachments, since annotations routinely serialize before the geometry they label;
a `CImage` reader (previously missing entirely — any legacy file with a dropped-in image was
rejected outright); attribute value types `0x11` (Point3d) and `0x0C` (Length); and the
"burned" store-map-index mechanism itself — SketchUp maps some connection points into the archive's
object table without serializing bytes for them, silently offsetting every later back-reference,
now translated through a dedicated burn-band mechanism rather than shifting already-registered
slots in place (an earlier fix attempt could strand a slot value captured earlier in the same
read). Also includes a self-calibrating trailer width for `CConstructionLine` (varies by SketchUp's
writing build, not cleanly by version) and a v20 layer-list null-separator fix — a real,
previously-miscounted fixture file gained its second layer as a result. Verified on a 186-file real
corpus (up from 0/2 passing on the two originally-failing repro files) and cross-checked
per-language against Python's own parse output on large real files.

### Fixed

- **`CoEdge.orientation` was inverted in several readers.** Documented
  everywhere as `+1` = same direction as the edge, `-1` = reversed, but
  Python, TypeScript, .NET, and Dart passed SketchUp's raw storage bit
  straight through instead (`0`/`1`, the opposite sense) in at least one
  of their two parsing paths. Any consumer following the documented
  contract got backwards orientation. C++ already had this fixed.
- **Legacy Dynamic Component attributes were silently never found.** The
  lookup compared each attribute container's *class name* (always the
  same string) against the dictionary's own name instead of comparing the
  dictionary's actual declared name — the comparison could never succeed,
  so `Instance.properties` silently came back empty on every legacy
  (pre-2021) file that genuinely had Dynamic Component data. Fixed in
  Python, TypeScript, .NET, and Dart; C++ already did this correctly.
- **Material transparency was dropped from glTF/GLB scene export**, in
  every language — exported materials were hardcoded fully opaque with no
  `alphaMode` declared. Translucent materials now export with `BLEND`;
  textured cutout materials (foliage, fences, signage) with `MASK`. .NET's
  fix goes one layer deeper: the legacy binary reader itself was
  discarding the color record's alpha byte during parsing.
- **XML entity decoding in material/style names** (TypeScript, C++) — a
  name containing `&amp;`/`&lt;`/etc. from the file's internal XML
  metadata came through un-decoded.
- **A TLV header-scan off-by-one silently dropped a record whose 6-byte
  header exactly filled the remaining buffer space** — a real, valid
  record, not corrupt data. Present in both the general recursive parser
  and the flat top-level scanner behind lazy iteration over large files,
  in Python, Dart, and .NET (TypeScript and C++ already had the correct
  comparison). Could drop a trailing top-level definition on a real file,
  not just a nested child node.
- **A SketchUp-2020 filler-recovery heuristic ignored its caller's
  plausibility limit** (Python) — every call site shared one hardcoded
  ceiling instead of the tighter, call-site-specific limit every other
  language already used, so byte-garbage could occasionally win the
  search over the correct candidate on a real v20 file.
- **An empty component/group definition name was fabricated into a
  placeholder** (`"Definition123"`/`"Def123"`) on `open_existing()`/
  `to_*_code()` replay, in all 5 languages — SketchUp Groups are
  internally unnamed component definitions, so this is common in real
  files, not an edge case. The definition's real (empty) name now
  survives the round trip unchanged.
- **`classify_element()`'s IFC export only matched keywords against a
  component's own name**, so real files whose components keep SketchUp's
  default names (`Component#109415`) exported as almost entirely generic
  `IfcBuildingElementProxy`, losing semantic typing. Now falls back to the
  layer/tag name when the component name doesn't match anything, and
  accepts an optional custom classifier callback for callers who want
  full control. All 5 languages.
- **Every entry in `Scene.mesh_index` got the same, wrong `name`** — the
  outermost ancestor instance's own name, cascading down to every mesh
  beneath it — instead of each mesh's own, correctly-nested name. Caused
  by matching an instance's properties/name onto `mesh_index` by a
  *substring* of its path rather than an exact match; since a shallow
  instance's path is always a string prefix of every descendant's path
  too, the shallowest instance's write always "won" for its entire
  subtree. Fixed in Python, TypeScript, .NET, and Dart (also a genuine
  performance win for .NET, replacing an O(instances × meshes) scan with
  an O(1)-per-instance lookup — measured at ~73 minutes on a real
  323,856-instance file). C++ never had this bug.
- **A SketchUp-2020 filler-recovery heuristic that only checked a byte's
  low bit could misdetect a value that happened to be a multiple of
  256** — ported from an existing TypeScript fix to .NET, Dart, and C++
  (Python was independently already correct, via a differently-shaped
  fix).
- **GLB export silently merged differently-textured materials that
  happened to average to the same flat color**, and none of Python's,
  .NET's, Dart's, or C++'s GLB writers embedded texture images at all
  (`toGLB()` exported color-only materials even for a textured source
  file) — ported from an existing TypeScript fix to all four.

### Performance

- Python's TLV parser (`_core.parse_tlv_recursive`) no longer builds a
  `dict` per record or copies a leaf's payload bytes eagerly — tag bytes
  are read via a lookup table instead of `.hex().upper()`, and a leaf's
  payload is resolved lazily (only when actually read) and cached. Was
  measured consuming 98% of parse time on a real 305 MB/1644-material
  production file.

### Security

- Bumped `vitest` (1.6.1 → 3.2.7) and `vite-node` (1.6.1 → 6.0.0) in the
  TypeScript package, resolving 6 flagged vulnerabilities (1 critical: the
  Vitest UI server allowed arbitrary file read/execute).

### Changed

- **Python now requires 3.10+** (was 3.9+); 3.9 reached its own upstream
  end-of-life. Existing 3.9 installations are unaffected — `pip`'s
  resolver caps them at the last version that declared 3.9 support; only
  future releases require 3.10+.
- The writer now validates every `material`/`back_material`/`layer`
  argument against handles the same builder actually issued, in all 5
  languages, and raises immediately on a mismatch (e.g. a layer handle
  passed where a material was expected) instead of silently accepting it.
  Found via a real user bug report: a plain argument-order slip produced
  a `.skp` file that round-tripped fine through this library's own reader
  but real SketchUp rejected outright as corrupt.
- Routine dependency maintenance (numpy, Pillow, pytest-cov,
  `typescript-eslint`, eslint).

### Removed

- Dead `packages/python/src/openskp/geometry.py` module — its entire
  geometry-extraction pipeline had zero live callers; the actual live
  path has always been `_core.py`'s separately-named equivalent.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-20

**Write support, now in all five languages.** OpenSKP can *create* new
`.skp` files from scratch, not just parse existing ones — a genuine,
from-scratch binary writer for the legacy MFC `CArchive` format (SketchUp
2013–2020), built by inverting the existing reader's own decoding logic
rather than wrapping any SDK. Landed in Python first (previously the
`[Unreleased]` entry on this file); this release ports the identical
feature set — geometry, materials, layers, component definitions and
groups (including nesting), circular/arc curves, freeform polylines,
faces with holes, auto-triangulation, custom attributes, and the
`open_existing()`/edit path — to TypeScript, .NET, Dart, and C++.
TypeScript, .NET, and Dart are each verified byte-identical to Python's
own already-SDK-validated output on the same input; C++ (no local
compiler available in this project's environment) is verified structurally
- every embedded byte constant cross-checked against Python's real
values - plus its own full test suite passing in CI across GCC, Clang,
and MSVC. See [Write capabilities](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#write-capabilities) in
the Developer Guide for the full picture and the naming convention each
language follows.

The entry point per language:

| Language | Start building | Edit an existing file |
|---|---|---|
| Python | `openskp.create()` | `openskp.open_existing()` |
| TypeScript | `create()` | `openExisting()` |
| .NET | `SkpCreate.NewFile()` | `SkpEdit.OpenExisting()` |
| Dart | `create()` | `openExisting()` |
| C++ | `openskp::create()` | `openskp::open_existing()` |

Every other method follows each language's own naming convention on top
of the same underlying API shape (`add_face`/`addFace`/`AddFace`,
`add_material`/`addMaterial`/`AddMaterial`, and so on) — see the table in
[Write capabilities](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#write-capabilities) for the
complete mapping, including where component-definition scoping differs
(Python's `with` context manager vs. TypeScript/Dart's callback-based
`addComponentDefinition(name, (def) => {...})` vs. .NET's `using`
block vs. C++'s explicit `.close()`).

### Added — writer, ported to TypeScript/.NET/Dart/C++

- `openskp.create()` / `SkpBuilder` — build faces (planar, including
  concave polygons and non-manifold shared edges) directly from vertex
  coordinates, with automatic vertex/edge sharing wherever coordinates
  coincide exactly.
- Solid-color and image-textured materials (`add_material`,
  `add_texture_material` — PNG and JPEG, detected from the file's own
  magic bytes), assignable independently to a face's front and back side.
- Named layers (`add_layer`).
- Reusable component definitions with multiple independently-positioned
  instances (`add_component_definition`, `add_instance`), and groups
  (`add_group`, which place themselves automatically on close rather than
  needing a separate placement call).
- Nested definitions — a component definition can contain instances of
  another, already-built definition inside its own body
  (`ComponentDefinitionBuilder.add_instance`), the same assembly-of-parts
  nesting real SketchUp supports, to any depth. A nested placement can
  also be a *group* rather than a component instance
  (`ComponentDefinitionBuilder.add_group_instance`) — this format has no
  way to declare one definition's body inside another's, so the group's
  own geometry still has to be built with a normal
  `add_component_definition` first, then placed here.
- Explicit texture positioning (`add_face`'s `front_uv`/`back_uv`) —
  scale, rotate, shear, and offset a face's texture independently per
  side instead of the default planar projection, given 3 world-point/UV
  correspondences. Works on a face of any orientation, tilted or not.
- Per-face/per-edge hidden, soft, and smooth flags.
- Custom key/value attribute dictionaries (`attributes` on
  `add_component_definition`, `add_instance`, and `add_face`) — the same
  mechanism SketchUp's own "dynamic component" attributes use. Values may
  be `str`, `int`, or `float`; not yet supported on groups, since ground
  truth shows a group's own attribute pointer is always null unlike a
  component instance's.
- Circular faces (`add_circle` on `SkpBuilder`/`ComponentDefinitionBuilder`)
  — a genuine, editable-by-radius SketchUp arc/circle entity (`CArcCurve`),
  not `num_segments` disconnected straight edges that merely trace that
  shape. Every edge in the tessellation shares one real curve backref,
  confirmed via the SDK's own `SUEdgeGetCurve`/`SUCurveGetType` to resolve
  to a single, correctly-typed arc entity.
- Partial (open) arcs (`add_arc`) — the same genuine `CArcCurve` entity as
  `add_circle`, but a chain of edges with no face, swept between
  caller-given `start_angle`/`end_angle` (radians). Confirmed via the SDK
  that the written endpoint coordinates land exactly where the requested
  sweep says they should, not just that "some curve object" exists.
- Freeform polyline curves (`add_polyline`) — an arbitrary chain of
  straight edges (open or `closed`) grouped into one genuine `CCurve`
  entity, distinct from `CArcCurve`'s own geometric frame: just a type
  tag and an edge count, ground-truth-derived from SDK-authored open and
  closed polylines of several edge counts. Confirmed via the SDK that
  every edge shares the same curve object, typed as `SUCurveType_Simple`
  (not `ArcCurve`), with the correct edge count.
- Every file now opens to the standard "Iso" view (parallel projection,
  looking at the origin) instead of the blank scaffold's own arbitrary
  default camera.
- No SketchUp SDK dependency at import, write, or any other runtime path.
  The bundled blank-document scaffold this module splices geometry into
  is disclosed plainly as SDK-authored boilerplate (Trimble's own
  built-in empty-document bytes, not anyone's creative work) in the
  module's own docstring — the writer logic itself (the entity encoding,
  the object-graph protocol, the tail-reference renumbering) is 100%
  independently reverse-engineered.
- `openskp.open_existing()` (`openskp.edit` module) — load an *existing*
  legacy-format `.skp` file and rebuild it as a new `SkpBuilder`, so more
  geometry can be added before saving. Real SketchUp itself never patches
  a file in place (it fully re-serializes on every save), so this works
  by fully parsing the source with this project's own reader and
  replaying everything it understood — materials, layers, every
  component definition, all root-level geometry/instances — back through
  the writer's own API, rather than touching the original bytes at all.
  Round-trip-validated against real, non-writer-authored architectural
  models (not just files this project's own writer produced), confirming
  face/instance/definition counts and the real SDK's own acceptance of
  the rebuilt file. Returns a list of warnings for anything the source
  file had that couldn't be faithfully reproduced (a projected texture,
  a colorized material's tint, and several others — see the module's
  own docstring for the complete, itemized list) rather than silently
  dropping it.
- `rotation=(axis, angle_radians)` on `add_instance`/`add_group`/
  `add_group_instance` — a convenience alternative to hand-deriving a
  `matrix3x3` rotation matrix for the common case of a pure rotation
  (Rodrigues' rotation formula). Confirmed against the real SDK's own
  `SUComponentInstanceGetTransform` to match SketchUp's transform
  convention exactly, not just "some rotation was applied."
- `add_face(..., auto_triangulate=True)` — a non-coplanar polygon (a
  tessellated curved surface's warped "quad," the case that previously
  had to be hand-split into triangles before calling `add_face` at all)
  is now fan-triangulated into real, always-planar faces automatically
  instead of raising, the same silent fallback real SketchUp's own UI
  applies when you draw a not-quite-flat face. Off by default — existing
  strict-planarity behavior is unchanged unless opted into.
- `add_face(..., holes=[...])` — cut one or more independent closed
  polygons out of a face (a window opening in a wall, say) as real
  additional loops in the same `CFace` record, not a separate,
  unconnected geometry hack. Ground-truth-derived from an SDK-authored
  window-in-a-wall face: a hole loop is structurally identical to the
  boundary loop except one flag byte, and its winding direction doesn't
  matter (confirmed via the SDK's own geometry-input API accepting
  either, and independently by writing raw bytes both ways). Confirmed
  against the real SDK that the hole's area is genuinely subtracted
  (`SUFaceGetArea`), not just structurally present.
  `openskp.open_existing()` now replays a multi-loop face faithfully
  instead of skipping it.
- `SkpBuilder.materials_by_name`/`layers_by_name` — every material/layer
  registered so far, by name, always kept up to date as a side effect of
  `add_material`/`add_texture_material`/`add_layer` (previously a private,
  undocumented implementation detail). `openskp.open_existing()` now
  also returns a third value, `definitions` (component definition name →
  its builder), so a caller can reuse the source file's own materials,
  layers, and component definitions on new geometry — e.g.
  `builder.add_face(pts, material=builder.materials_by_name["Walnut"])`
  or `builder.add_instance(definitions["Wheel"], translation=...)` —
  without reaching into a private attribute. Registering a genuinely NEW
  material/layer/definition/group on the returned builder still isn't
  possible (the file format's own ordering requirement is already
  satisfied by the time replay finishes writing root-level geometry);
  that limitation is now documented and tested rather than just
  discovered by trial and error.
- `hidden=True` on `add_instance`/`add_group`/`add_group_instance` — hides
  that specific placement (its contents still exist in the file), the
  same drawbase bit `add_face`'s own `hidden` already used. `color=`/
  `hidden=` on `add_layer` — the layer's own color and default
  visibility, both already exposed on the read side as `Layer.color_r/g/
  b`/`Layer.hidden` but previously fixed at a hardcoded default on write.
  All three confirmed against the real SDK (`SUDrawingElementGetHidden`,
  `SULayerGetVisibility`). `openskp.open_existing()` now replays both
  faithfully instead of warning that they were dropped.

### Fixed

- Calling `add_face`/`add_instance` on the root builder while a component
  definition was still open (its `with` block not yet exited) silently
  produced a corrupted file instead of raising — found while testing
  group nesting, unrelated to it otherwise. Now raises immediately.
- `write_face` validated texture-positioning correspondences and
  attribute values only partway through writing a face's bytes - a
  caller that caught the resulting `SkpWriteError` and kept building
  (exactly what `open_existing()`'s replay does when skipping one
  unsupported face) was left with orphaned, uncounted edges silently
  corrupting everything written afterward, with no error surfaced until
  the file failed to fully parse. Both checks now run before any bytes
  are written.
- `write_textured_material`'s placeholder average-color always had a
  fully-opaque alpha byte, which `legacy.py`'s reader treats as one of
  its two signals that a material is a colorized (tinted) variant - every
  plain (non-colorized) texture this writer created was silently
  misreported as colorized when read back. Found via `open_existing()`
  round-tripping the writer's own output.
- **A large model (total archive-slot count crossing 32,767) produced a
  corrupted file real SketchUp rejected outright.** An archive slot of
  exactly `0x7FFF` (32767) is unrepresentable in the format's short
  2-byte reference form no matter which encoding would otherwise apply -
  it's byte-identical to either the big-tag escape marker or the
  new-class-declaration marker, both of which `legacy.py`'s reader
  checks before it ever considers "this is just a normal reference" -
  confirmed by tracing the actual read dispatch order, not just the
  protocol table. `_backref`/`_new_of_known_class` used an off-by-one
  `<= 0x7FFF` boundary that let slot 32767 through in the ambiguous short
  form; `_shift_ref` (used to renumber a handful of fixed pointers in the
  blank scaffold's tail region when new slots are inserted) additionally
  had no escape-widening at all, silently wrapping any shifted reference
  past that boundary back into the wrong slot. Reverting the fix
  reproduces the exact reported symptom: real SketchUp's SDK rejects the
  file outright (`SUModelCreateFromFile` error), and — more seriously —
  this project's own reader doesn't error either, it silently drops
  roughly 40% of a 5,000-face reproduction's faces with no error
  surfaced at all. Found while reviewing a large-model (31,966-face)
  export failure report from a downstream project (IngeTrazo) building a
  `.skp` exporter on this writer; independently re-derived and verified
  rather than taken on faith, including a before/after real-SketchUp-SDK
  comparison on the exact failure shape.

### Validation

Every capability above is verified against the real SketchUp SDK
(`SketchUpAPI.dll` used strictly as a local, offline validation oracle —
never a runtime dependency), not just against OpenSKP's own reader —
several silent-failure fields (drawbase padding, loop flags, attribute
container requirements) only show up as `SU_ERROR_MODEL_INVALID` in real
SketchUp despite parsing cleanly through this project's own code. A
combined "kitchen sink" test exercises every feature together in one
file (materials, layers, textures, definitions, instances, groups,
concave/non-manifold geometry) and is checked at scale (hundreds of
entities) as a regression guard.

### Explicitly out of scope for this first pass

- Declaring a group's geometry inline nested inside another definition's
  own body, the way `add_group` self-places at the root level - this
  format has no mechanism for one definition's declaration to live inside
  another's, so a nested group's geometry has to be built separately
  first (see `add_group_instance` above).
- Writing the modern VFF (2021+) container - every language's writer
  only ever produces the legacy MFC format, the same restriction
  `open_existing()` places on its own source file.

### Fixed — TypeScript

- `retryCountAfterV20Filler`'s byte-at-a-time zero-padding scan
  misidentified a v20 filler-record count that was an exact multiple of
  256 (its own low byte is `0x00`, indistinguishable from padding to
  that scan), misaligning every read after it. Rewritten to probe whole
  u32s at 4-byte strides instead of inspecting individual bytes, which
  can't be fooled by a zero low byte the same way. Follow-up to a review
  note on #155; thanks to [Marco Sumari](https://github.com/tuxiasumari)
  for tracking it down. (#192)

### Added — TypeScript

- `toGLB(scene, { textures: true })` — embed the scene's texture images
  in the GLB export and point each textured material's
  `baseColorTexture` at them, opt-in since it can multiply the exported
  file's size. Off by default, output byte-identical to before. Also
  fixes material identity: materials were previously deduplicated by
  colour alone, silently merging two different textures that happened to
  average to the same RGB - the texture is now part of the dedup key too.
  Thanks to [Thomaz Yuji Baba](https://github.com/thomazyujibaba). (#193)

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-13

First stable release. All five language ports (Python, TypeScript, Dart,
C# / .NET, C++) now carry full feature parity: parsing (geometry,
materials, layers, dynamic properties, metadata) and native, dependency-light
export to GLB, JSON, Wavefront OBJ/MTL, STL, PLY, DXF (3DFACE and AutoCAD
Polyface Mesh), and IFC4 (BIM) — verified against real-world `.skp` fixtures
and, for DXF specifically, against real desktop AutoCAD rather than lenient
readers alone.

### Added

- **All 5 languages**: native Wavefront OBJ exporter (`to_obj`/`toOBJ`/
  `toObj`/`ToObj`, plus a file-writing counterpart in each language —
  Python's is `openskp.export.obj.export()`, the other four are
  `exportOBJ`/`exportObj`/`ExportObj`). InvariantCulture/classic-C-locale
  formatting is enforced everywhere to guarantee dot decimal separators
  regardless of the host OS locale.
- **All 5 languages**: native STL exporter, both ASCII (`.stl`) and
  little-endian binary (`_bin.stl`), with an optional `scale` multiplier
  (default 1.0 for metres, 1000.0 for mm, matching what slicers like Cura/
  PrusaSlicer/Bambu Studio expect). Verified byte-identical output (9,368,084
  bytes, 187,360 triangles) across languages on the same real fixture.
- **All 5 languages**: native PLY exporter (Polygon File Format), both ASCII
  and little-endian binary, carrying vertex positions, normals, UV
  coordinates, and RGBA vertex colors. C++'s binary writer uses
  architecture-independent bitwise shifts rather than relying on host
  endianness. Verified byte-identical output (9,316,015 bytes, 187,360
  triangles) across languages on the same real fixture.
- **All 5 languages**: rich Wavefront OBJ/MTL extension — a companion
  `.mtl` material-library writer (`to_mtl`/`toMTL`/`toMtl`/`ToMtl`) emitting
  `newmtl`/`Ka`/`Kd`/`Ks`/`Ns`/`d`/`illum` records plus `map_Kd` texture
  references, with `to_obj` gaining an optional `mtl_filename` parameter to
  link the two via `mtllib`. The `.obj` writer itself gained `vt` (UV) and
  `vn` (normal) records, upgrading it from a positions-only debug dump to a
  properly textured/shaded mesh format.
- **All 5 languages**: native 3D DXF exporter, targeting AutoCAD R2000
  (`AC1015`) compliance — full HEADER/CLASSES/TABLES/BLOCKS/OBJECTS
  scaffold, `LAYER` table entries with ACI color codes, and entity output in
  either `3DFACE` mode or AutoCAD Polyface Mesh mode (`POLYLINE` type 64 +
  `VERTEX` + `SEQEND`). Polyface is now the default mode (previously
  `3dface`), since it's the form AutoCAD itself generates for triangulated
  meshes. See Fixed below — the exporter's real-world compatibility with
  desktop AutoCAD required a second, much deeper pass beyond what made
  lenient DXF readers (`ezdxf`) accept it.
- **All 5 languages**: native IFC4 (BIM) exporter — ISO-10303-21 STEP ASCII
  output with a full `IfcProject → IfcSite → IfcBuilding → IfcBuildingStorey
  → IfcProduct` spatial hierarchy, `IfcTriangulatedFaceSet` tessellated
  geometry, best-effort element classification (walls/doors/windows/slabs/
  columns/beams/roofs, defaulting to `IfcBuildingElementProxy`), dynamic
  properties via `IfcPropertySet`/`IfcRelDefinesByProperties`, material
  colors via `IfcColourRgb`/`IfcSurfaceStyleRendering`, and layer
  preservation via `IfcPresentationLayerAssignment`. Validated with
  `IfcOpenShell` against two real-world files, including a 26.94 MB / 101,692-
  property export.
- **Web viewer**: the single "Export GLB" button is now an "Export Model"
  dropdown covering every format the library supports — JSON, IFC4, DXF
  (both Polyface Mesh and 3DFACE), PLY, STL, GLB, and OBJ. All formats share
  one `downloadFile()` helper (Blob + object URL, revoked after use), and
  exported filenames now derive from the uploaded `.skp`'s own name instead
  of a fixed stem.

- **Dart**: `toGlb(Scene)`/`exportGlb(Scene, path)` - binary glTF 2.0
  (GLB) export, matching Python's and C++'s `to_glb`/`export_glb` pair
  (same scope as the .NET entry below). A from-scratch writer with no new
  dependency - `dart:convert`'s built-in `jsonEncode` covers the JSON
  chunk directly, no custom serializer needed (simpler than .NET's port,
  which had to hand-roll one since `netstandard2.0` has no built-in JSON
  support). Same TEXCOORD_0 correction as .NET's port relative to the
  TypeScript reference. `exportGlb` doesn't create missing parent
  directories, matching C++/.NET's `export_glb`/`ExportGlb`. One
  Dart-specific wrinkle: `GlbPrimitive`'s fields are `List<double>`
  (64-bit) here, but the binary accessor data is float32 - min/max
  bounds are now read back from the already-written float32 buffer
  rather than computed from the raw doubles, so they match what's
  actually in the accessor. Verified against the real fixture: chunk
  headers, mesh/material counts, and decoded UV values all confirmed
  correct, byte-for-byte identical (after accounting for float32
  rounding) to the already cross-verified Python/TypeScript/C#/.NET
  output on the same file.
- **.NET**: `GlbExport.ToGlb(Scene)`/`GlbExport.ExportGlb(Scene, path)` -
  binary glTF 2.0 (GLB) export, matching Python's and C++'s
  `to_glb`/`export_glb` pair (TypeScript only has the bytes-returning
  variant). A from-scratch writer with no new dependency, matching how
  this project has stayed dependency-light everywhere except C++'s
  bundled TinyGLTF - `netstandard2.0` has no built-in JSON support, so
  this also adds a small internal `MiniJson` serializer (reflection-based,
  just enough to cover the object graphs this writer builds; not a
  general-purpose JSON library). Ported from the TypeScript reference
  implementation's `toGLB()`, with one correction: TS's own `toGLB()`
  still doesn't write `TEXCOORD_0` despite `GlbPrimitive.uvs` existing
  there too (tracked as a separate follow-up) - .NET's writer includes it
  from the start. `ExportGlb` doesn't create missing parent directories,
  matching C++'s `export_glb` (the other language with this same pair).
  Verified against a real fixture: magic/chunk headers, mesh/material
  counts, and decoded UV values all confirmed correct, with the UV values
  byte-for-byte identical to the already cross-verified Python/TypeScript/
  C#/Dart output on the same file.
- **Python**: `export.json_export.to_dict()`'s output gained a top-level
  `root` key with the model's implicit top-level definition (matching
  `SkpModel.root`) - previously only `definitions` (the numeric-ID-keyed
  component/group definitions) was included, so the JSON export silently
  omitted any geometry/instances placed directly in the model rather than
  inside a component.

- **TypeScript**: `Face` gained `uvProjected`/`uvProjectedBack` fields.
  The legacy MFC reader already decoded these bits internally
  (`front_projected`/`back_projected` on the `CFaceTextureCoords` record)
  but discarded them instead of exposing them, same gap Python closed in
  #61. A PROJECTED texture (e.g. the Add Location terrain drape) has UVs
  that run in the projection plane's frame, not the face frame - callers
  need to know this to render it correctly. VFF/modern files don't carry
  this flag at all, so it correctly defaults to `false` there, matching
  Python's precedent.
- **Dart**: `Face` gained `uvProjected`/`uvProjectedBack` fields, same fix
  and same rationale as the TypeScript entry above.
- **.NET**: `Face` gained `UvProjected`/`UvProjectedBack` properties, same
  fix and same rationale as the TypeScript/Dart entries above.
- **C++**: `Face` gained `uv_projected`/`uv_projected_back` fields, same
  rationale as the TypeScript/Dart/.NET entries above. See the Fixed
  section for why this needed more than exposing two bits.

- **Python**: `scene.GlbPrimitive` gained a `uvs` field with real per-vertex
  texture coordinates, computed from each source face's `uv_transform` (or
  the default face-plane projection when a face has none) — see
  `Face.uv_transform`'s docstring for the formula. Vertices are now split
  where two faces sharing a position disagree on UV, since indexed glTF
  meshes need position/normal/uv aligned per vertex. Fixes #62 for Python;
  other languages exposing the same `GlbPrimitive` shape are being ported
  separately. Faces with `uv_projected` set (terrain-drape textures) still
  use the face-plane formula, since the real projection-plane basis isn't
  captured anywhere in the parsed data yet — their UVs are approximate.
- **.NET**: `Scene.GlbPrimitive` gained a `Uvs` field, same fix as the
  Python entry above and the exact issue #62 was filed against (its
  `GlbPrimitive` snippet). Verified numerically identical to Python's
  output (to float precision) on the same real fixture.
- **TypeScript**: `GlbPrimitive` gained a `uvs` field, same fix as the
  Python/.NET entries above. Verified numerically identical to both on the
  same real fixture.
- **C++**: `GlbPrimitive` gained a `uvs` field, same fix as the other three
  ports. Unlike those, C++'s `to_glb`/`export_glb` write real `.glb` files
  directly from this struct, so this PR also wires a `TEXCOORD_0` accessor
  into the actual glTF output - exported files now carry real texture
  coordinates, not just the in-memory struct. C++ also uniquely models
  front/back materials as separate primitives; the back-side primitive
  (when present) uses `uv_transform_back` with the same face-plane basis
  as the front, per the documented recipe - this path has no cross-language
  reference to verify against, since no other port models back materials
  at all.
- **Dart**: `GlbPrimitive` gained a `uvs` field, same fix as the other
  ports. This closes out #62 across every language whose scene-baking
  layer exposes `GlbPrimitive` - Python, .NET, TypeScript, C++, and now
  Dart all compute numerically identical UV values (to float precision) on
  the same real fixture. Dart has no `.glb` file writer yet (tracked
  separately), so this reaches the `GlbPrimitive` data shape only, same as
  the Python/.NET/TypeScript entries above.
- **Python**: `export.glb.export()` - the actual `.glb` file writer, a
  separate legacy pipeline from `scene.py`'s `build_scene()` - now writes
  real per-vertex UV coordinates too, closing the same gap as above for
  Python's literal exported files (matching what C++'s PR already did for
  its own file writer). Faces are now grouped into one mesh per resolved
  color per definition, same as `scene.py`, since a single trimesh mesh
  can only carry one material - previously this pipeline put every face
  of a definition into one mesh with a flat per-face color array,
  regardless of how many distinct materials were mixed in (confirmed on a
  real fixture: 2 of 3 definitions mix colors). Verified numerically
  identical UV output to `scene.py`'s on three real files (both legacy
  MFC and modern VFF format).

- **C++**: public `to_glb(const Scene&)` and `export_glb(const Scene&, path)`
  APIs for in-memory and file-based binary glTF 2.0 export. The implementation
  uses privately bundled TinyGLTF 2.9.7, validates scene geometry and PBR data,
  and keeps TinyGLTF out of installed headers and consumer link interfaces.

### Fixed

- **All 5 languages**: the DXF exporter produced files that `ezdxf.readfile()`
  (and even `ezdxf`'s own `.audit()`) accepted without complaint, but real
  desktop AutoCAD rejected outright — first with "Invalid or incomplete DXF
  input", later with "Did not receive PlotStyleName" once the more obvious
  problems were fixed. `ezdxf` is too lenient to catch what AutoCAD enforces
  internally, and there's no public, comprehensive list of those rules, so
  this was tracked down using real desktop AutoCAD as the only reliable
  oracle, then cross-checked against what real `ezdxf` itself emits for
  equivalent structures. Five distinct root causes, byte-verified against a
  real `ezdxf`-generated file confirmed to open cleanly in AutoCAD:
  1. An incomplete HEADER/CLASSES/TABLES/BLOCKS/OBJECTS scaffold — a
     near-empty `CLASSES` table, a fabricated `VPORT` record, and a stripped
     `OBJECTS` dictionary tree missing `MATERIAL`/`MLINESTYLE`/
     `MLEADERSTYLE` records and a second `LAYOUT` record — all boilerplate
     AutoCAD requires but lenient readers never check.
  2. Every dynamically-generated `LAYER` record was missing group `370`
     (lineweight) and `390` (PlotStyleName handle); AutoCAD rejects the
     whole `TABLES` section without them once a drawing uses a Named plot
     style table. Also dropped group `420` (24-bit true color), an R2004+
     field real `ezdxf` never emits for R2000/AC1015 — ACI (`62`) is the
     only color mechanism R2000 supports.
  3. Polyface `POLYLINE`/`VERTEX`/`SEQEND` structure had three mismatches
     against real `ezdxf`'s own polyface output: face-record `VERTEX`
     entries were missing color (`62`) and dummy `0/0/0` coordinates while
     carrying a subclass marker they shouldn't have, and `SEQEND`'s owner
     (`330`) pointed at Model_Space instead of its parent `POLYLINE`'s own
     handle. This is exactly why `3dface` mode opened fine while `polyface`
     mode was rejected, despite sharing the same scaffold.
  4. TypeScript, Dart, C#, and C++ never substituted the `$HANDSEED`
     placeholder — every file these four exporters ever produced shipped
     the literal text `__HANDSEED__` instead of a real hex value.
  5. Unbounded layer names could exceed AutoCAD's documented limits; added a
     defensive 255-character cap with a collision-safe hash suffix on
     truncation.

  Dynamic handles now start at `0x691`, matching the reference file's own
  first entity handle, keeping every handle in an export globally unique.
  Both `3dface` and `polyface` output confirmed opening cleanly in real
  desktop AutoCAD after this fix (C++ mirrors the same verified structure
  but could not be locally compiled/run in the environment this was fixed
  in — CI is the correctness gate there).
- **Python**: `export.dxf.export()` didn't set `newline=''` when opening the
  output file on Windows, so `open()`'s universal-newline translation turned
  every `\r\n` the writer emitted into `\r\r\n` (double carriage returns),
  which CAD viewers rejected. Explicit 3DFACE output was affected before the
  fix above even applied.
- **TypeScript**: `toGLB()` never wrote a `TEXCOORD_0` accessor, despite
  `GlbPrimitive.uvs` existing on its data model since #65 - real UV data
  was computed but the actual exported `.glb` bytes never carried it.
  Found while using `toGLB()` as the structural reference for porting GLB
  export to .NET and Dart (both new writers included `TEXCOORD_0` from
  the start rather than reproducing this gap). Same shape as the gap
  already fixed for Python's `export/glb.py` (#68) and C++'s `glb.cpp`
  (#66). No test coverage existed for `toGLB()` before now, which is how
  this went unnoticed - added real coverage, including a real-fixture
  round-trip test that decodes every primitive's `TEXCOORD_0` back out of
  the binary chunk and confirms it matches the source `GlbPrimitive.uvs`
  exactly.
- **C++**: `Face.uv_transform`/`uv_transform_back` were never populated for
  *any* legacy MFC (SketchUp 2013–2020) file - every legacy face's UV
  silently fell back to the default (non-positioned) face-plane
  projection, even when the SketchUp author had explicitly positioned or
  photo-fitted a texture. Root cause: `CFace`'s attribute container (the
  MFC record that holds its `CFaceTextureCoords` mapping, alongside any
  other attribute dictionaries) was being read - correctly advancing the
  archive cursor - and then discarded, never linked back to the face.
  Found while investigating a smaller, originally-scoped task (exposing
  the already-decoded PROJECTED-texture bit); turned out the bit lived in
  a record that was never reachable at all. Fixed by capturing the
  attribute container's slot on `CFace`, capturing attribute-container
  children as they're read (previously discarded there too), and
  resolving both when building each face. Verified against a real fixture
  the count of faces with a real `uv_transform` now matches Python's
  independently-verified count exactly (32) - previously this would have
  been 0 for every legacy file, always.
- **Python**: `export.glb.export()` crashed on any file with a textured
  material - the metadata JSON sidecar it writes tried to embed each
  material's raw texture image bytes directly, which was never
  JSON-serializable, so `json.dump` raised `TypeError`. There was no
  existing test coverage for this function, which is how this went
  uncaught. Now stripped before serialization - the `.glb` file itself
  carries the actual texture data, a JSON metadata file was never the
  right place for it.
- **Python, TypeScript, Dart, C++**: `Material.color`'s alpha channel was
  silently discarded when parsing legacy MFC (SketchUp 2013–2020) files —
  each language read the material's real 4-byte RGBA record but only kept
  the first three bytes, always reporting a hardcoded alpha regardless of
  what the file actually stored. .NET already read the real byte correctly;
  the other four now match it. Verified empirically across 2,060 materials
  in 13 real production files that this byte is always 255 in practice, but
  reading the real value is more correct than assuming a constant. The VFF
  (2021+) material record has no alpha attribute at all in any language —
  that path correctly continues to default to 255, since there's no real
  data to read there.

### Changed

- **Python**: `SkpModel.definitions` no longer contains an entry keyed by
  the string `"ROOT"`. The implicit top-level model (the file's directly
  placed, non-componentized geometry and instances) now has its own
  dedicated `SkpModel.root` field, matching TypeScript/.NET/Dart/C++'s
  `root`/`Root` exactly. Previously `definitions` was typed
  `Dict[int, Definition]` but silently held one non-`int` key at
  runtime — any code iterating `model.definitions.values()` to sum
  geometry across the whole file (not just named components) needs to
  also include `model.root` now, the same way the other four languages'
  own callers already do. `len(model.definitions)` is now the count of
  real named component/group definitions only, one lower than before.

### Removed

- **Python**: `SkpModel.scene_hierarchy` and `SkpModel.mesh_index` —
  dead fields that `parse()` never populated (always empty). Leftover
  from an earlier design; the real, populated versions of both concepts
  live on the separate `Scene` class returned by `build_scene()`, which
  is the pattern this project uses consistently everywhere else (a plain
  `parse()` stays light; a scene bake is opt-in and heavier). Any code
  reading these two fields was always seeing an empty list/dict — this
  removal cannot change observed behavior for a correctly-written
  caller, only surface a clear `AttributeError` instead of silently
  succeeding with fake-empty data for one that assumed they were real.

## [0.3.0] — C++ only — 2026-08-07

### Added

- **C++ package** — new independent C++17 port covering both modern
  VFF/ZIP (2021+) and legacy MFC (SketchUp 2013–2020) containers, at
  parity with the other four languages: geometry, components, layers,
  materials/textures, styles, dynamic properties, image entities,
  `parse()`/`build_scene()` scene baking, and observability hooks
  (progress/log callbacks). Installable CMake package with static and
  shared library builds, cross-platform CI (Linux/macOS/Windows,
  GCC/Clang/MSVC), and a test suite cross-validated against the same
  real fixture files already used by the Python/TypeScript/.NET/Dart
  ports. GLB export was not yet included in this initial release — see
  `[Unreleased]` above. Contributed by
  [Thomas Loockx](https://github.com/thomasloockx). Closes #29.

## [0.3.1] — TypeScript only — 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **TypeScript**: `packages/typescript/README.md` — the published npm page
  was still showing the pre-implementation placeholder README ("Under
  active development... coming soon", planned-features list, no working
  examples), unchanged since before the TypeScript port was actually
  written. Rewritten to describe the real, working package: accurate
  `parse()`/`buildScene()`/`toGLB()`/`toJSON()` quick start, observability
  options, and the known large-file memory limitation — each snippet
  checked against the actual exported types. Python, .NET, and Dart's
  READMEs were audited at the same time and found already accurate; only
  TypeScript needed this fix, which is why this release doesn't bump the
  other three languages' versions.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-29

All additions below are backwards-compatible (new defaulted dataclass
fields only; no existing field or behaviour removed) unless noted under
"Changed".

### Added

- **.NET package** — built from scratch: full VFF (2021+) parsing at
  parity with the other three languages (geometry, components, layers,
  materials/textures, styles, dynamic properties, image entities), plus
  full legacy MFC (SketchUp 2013–2020) support. Not yet released to
  NuGet.
- **Dart package** — built from scratch: same full VFF + legacy MFC
  parity as .NET. Not yet released to pub.dev.
- **All four languages**: opt-in scene baking — `build_scene()` /
  `buildScene()` / `BuildScene()` — resolves the *entire* placed
  instance tree to world-space, triangulates every face, and groups
  results into GLB-ready mesh primitives (`Scene`/`GlbPrimitive`).
  Deliberately kept separate from `parse()`/`Open()` (which stays light —
  raw per-definition geometry, no scene-graph resolution) since baking a
  file that reuses a handful of definitions across many instances can
  produce far more data than the file's raw geometry. TypeScript already
  had this; ported to Python, .NET, and Dart this round, each re-parsing
  independently rather than sharing a prior `parse()` call's data. .NET
  and Dart's triangulation uses a faithful port of
  [earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut) (the same algorithm
  TypeScript already used) rather than a from-scratch alternative.
- **All four languages**: **memory fix for large real-world files.**
  Files with 100,000+ component definitions previously required
  materializing the *entire* file's TLV tree in memory before extraction
  could begin; peak memory now scales with the size of the single
  largest top-level record instead of the whole file, via a lazy,
  streaming top-level iterator
  (`iter_top_level_lazy`/`iterTopLevelLazy`/`IterTopLevelLazy`) built on
  a cheap flat-header pre-scan. No change to any tag's decoding logic —
  purely an orchestration change. Verified against real production files
  up to 620 MB. .NET additionally needed `ChunkedBuffer` (a
  multi-segment buffer) plus widening TLV offsets from `int` to `long`,
  since the CLR's array/`MemoryStream` types have a hard ~2.1 GB ceiling
  that a decompressed `model.dat` can exceed. See
  [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#memory-architecture) for
  the full explanation, and
  [docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#performance) for
  verified per-language numbers — including TypeScript's remaining,
  currently-open memory ceiling on very large files, documented honestly
  rather than glossed over.
- **All four languages**: **observability** — opt-in progress reporting
  and structured, location-carrying parse errors, silent by default.
  Python uses the standard `logging` module
  (`logging.getLogger("openskp")`); TypeScript/.NET/Dart use an explicit
  options object with `onProgress`/`onLog` callbacks
  (`IProgress<T>`-based in .NET). A new `SkpParseError`/`SkpParseException`
  in every language carries `stage`/`recordIndex`/`totalRecords`/`tag`/
  `definitionId`, with the original failure always preserved (`__cause__`
  / `.cause` / `InnerException`). Full reference:
  [docs/OBSERVABILITY.md](docs/OBSERVABILITY.md).
- **TypeScript**: `model.root` — the implicit top-level definition
  (geometry/instances placed directly in the model, not inside any
  component/group) is now exposed on `parse()`'s result, matching .NET
  and Dart's `Root`/`root`. Previously dropped entirely from `parseSkp()`
  — the only way to reach it was the much heavier `buildScene()` call.
  Purely additive; `model.definitions` is unchanged.
- **Documentation**: [docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)
  (new) and [docs/OBSERVABILITY.md](docs/OBSERVABILITY.md) (new) —
  detailed, cross-language, verified against actual source and real
  files rather than aspirational. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and
  `docs/API_DESIGN.md` rewritten to match current reality (all four
  languages available, not "planned"). README rewritten: accurate
  per-language quick starts (the previous Python example referenced
  methods — `model.export_glb()`, `openskp.binary.VffReader` — that
  don't exist in the current package).

### Fixed

- **`examples/web-viewer`**: the web viewer called `parseSkp()` and read
  triangulated mesh data (`_glbPrimitives`/`meshIndex`/`_gltfMaterials`)
  directly off the result — the shape `parseSkp()` returned before the
  scene-baking split above. Every model would parse "successfully" but
  silently render zero meshes. Fixed to call the new `buildScene()`
  alongside `parseSkp()`.
- **Python**: `openskp.export.obj.export()` and
  `openskp.export.json_export`'s `scene_hierarchy` output both silently
  depended on `SkpModel.mesh_index`/`SkpModel.scene_hierarchy` — dataclass
  fields `parse()` never populates, always empty. `obj.export()` always
  wrote a near-empty `.obj` file; `json_export`'s `scene_hierarchy` key
  always serialized as `[]`, even though the rest of the JSON output was
  correct. Fixed: `obj.export()` now takes a built `Scene` (from
  `build_scene()`) and writes real geometry from its `glb_primitives`;
  `json_export.to_dict()`/`.export()` now accept an optional `scene=`
  parameter and use `Scene.scene_hierarchy`'s real, resolved instance tree
  when provided (`scene_hierarchy` is `None`, not a misleading `[]`, when
  omitted). This is a breaking signature change for `obj.export()`
  (previously `export(model, output_path)`, now
  `export(scene, output_path)`).

### Known limitations (not yet fixed)

- **Python**: `model.definitions` mixes real (integer-keyed) definitions
  with an implicit root entry under a `'ROOT'` **string key**, unlike
  TypeScript/.NET/Dart's separate `.root`/`.Root` property. Tracked as a
  follow-up; not changed yet since existing consumers may rely on the
  current shape.
- **TypeScript**: `parseSkp()`'s memory use scales significantly worse
  than the other three languages on very large files — see "memory fix"
  above. A 113 MB file needs 8–16 GB of Node heap; a 294 MB file fails
  even at 16 GB. Root-caused to V8's per-object overhead on millions of
  small geometry objects; a more compact internal representation is
  tracked as follow-up work.
- **GLB/OBJ/JSON export**: Python ships complete disk-writing exporters
  (`openskp.export.glb`/`obj`/`json_export`); TypeScript ships a complete
  in-memory GLB serializer (`toGLB()`) but no OBJ/JSON export yet; .NET
  and Dart expose the same triangulated scene data via `buildScene()` but
  a consumer needs to serialize it themselves.

- **Python**: `Material.id` and `SkpModel.materials_by_id` — expose the TLV
  material IDs that `Face.material_id` references, so callers can resolve a
  face's material (colour/transparency) from the public API. Previously the
  join existed only inside the internal exporter.
- **Python**: `Instance.material_id` — the material painted onto a component
  instance itself (SketchUp's "paint the component", the same `D007`/`D107`
  structure faces use). Faces with no material of their own inherit it;
  consumers can now resolve that inheritance like the official SDK does.
- **Python**: texture extraction — `Material.texture` (`Texture` dataclass:
  `filename`, tile `width`/`height` in inches, raw image `data` bytes,
  `save()` helper). Images are read from the material's folder inside the
  embedded ZIP, with a sibling fallback when the stored image name differs
  from `textureFilename`.
- **Python**: colourized materials — `Material.colorized` /
  `colorize_type`, and shared-texture resolution so a colourized copy
  (SketchUp's `[Name]1`, `type="2"`) resolves the image bytes it borrows
  from its source material's folder instead of returning `None`.
- **Python**: per-face texture mapping — `Face.uv_transform` /
  `uv_transform_back` (the 3×3 matrix a positioned / photo-fitted texture
  stores per face; SketchUp's texture pins). Includes the decoded recipe to
  turn it into UVs (plane basis from the normal, then
  `[x, y, 1] @ inv(M) / tile`), calibrated against SDK-exported ground
  truth to < 0.001 UV error, including projective (4-pin distorted)
  mappings.
- **Python**: `Face.back_material_id` — the material of a face's BACK side
  (the `AF0D` child of the face node). A face painted only on its back is
  common when the author paints the visible side of a downward-facing cap;
  without this field such faces looked unpainted.
- **Python**: `Edge.soft` / `smooth` / `hidden` — per-edge display flags
  decoded from the edge's `D307` byte, so viewers/exporters can hide facet
  lines of curved surfaces while keeping author-drawn coplanar edges.
- **Python**: styles — `SkpModel.styles` (`Style`: name, `front_color`,
  `back_color` RGB) parsed from `styles/*/style.xml` (signed-int32 ARGB
  items 4000/4001). Viewers need them to shade unpainted faces the way
  SketchUp does.
- **Python**: `Definition.always_faces_camera` — SketchUp's "always face
  camera" component behavior (2D people / tree cut-outs), decoded from the
  definition's behavior block (`581B` → sub-TLV `5D1B == 1`; its companion
  `5E1B` is "shadows face sun"). Consumers can now render such instances
  as billboards, like SketchUp does.
- **Python**: Image entities — a picture placed in the model as an object
  now parses: its placement wraps a standard instance node inside the
  image-specific `9013`/`401F` containers (previously opaque, so the image
  definition looked "never placed"), and `Definition.is_image` flags the
  single-quad definition backing it (TLV kind `8315 == 2`). Real-world
  case: photo cut-out statues/animals placed as images imported with no
  geometry at all.

### Fixed

- **Python**: entity names (materials, layers, definitions, instances,
  dynamic properties) now decode as **UTF-8** instead of ASCII-with-ignore.
  Dropping the non-ASCII bytes silently corrupted any accented name
  ("cópia" → "cpia", "Diseño" → "Diseo") and — critically — broke the
  material-name join between the TLV stream and the XML material files,
  leaving those materials unresolvable from geometry.

### Changed

- **Python** — ⚠️ **`Material.transparency` value change.** The `trans`
  attribute in `material.xml` is a *transparency* (0 = opaque, 1 = fully
  transparent), not an opacity, and only applies when `useTrans="1"`. The
  parser now exposes the resulting **opacity** as `1 - trans` (and `1.0`
  when `useTrans` is off). This corrects two prior behaviours — most
  materials previously read as 50% transparent (the parser default) and
  some as fully invisible (`trans="0"`) — but it also means
  `Material.transparency` returns **different numeric values for the same
  file** after this release: most materials move `0.5 → 1.0`, and genuinely
  translucent ones invert (e.g. SketchUp's "Translucent Glass Blue", 70%
  opacity, now reads `0.7` instead of `0.3`). **Audit any code that reads
  `Material.transparency` directly before upgrading.** Validated against
  SketchUp's own library materials.
